It may seem like a simple change, something essential, but it has been more complex than you think.

Now **you can choose the period of day you want and compare it with the previous period**.

But what's more, you'll notice this as soon as you log in, we've improved the performance of the Dashboard!

We still have some work to do, but right **now the dashboard loads 20% faster than before**.

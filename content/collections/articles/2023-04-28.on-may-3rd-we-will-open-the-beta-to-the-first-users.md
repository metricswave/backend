**After doing several tests, preparing the application and checking that everything is OK, we are ready to open the doors little by little to the first users.**

As you know, for now we are in a very early version of what we want NotifyWave to be.

For now we will only be available through a web site and you will only be able to trigger notifications with Webhook and On-time triggers.

But with this you will be able to, for example, integrate NotifyWave in your terminal among many other things. **We are looking forward to see what you do with our App.**

**From May 3rd we will be sending emails to the first LICENSED users to give them access to the application.**

**If you want to access as soon as possible, get your license (below) and you will receive the invitation very soon.**

If you're looking for a Google Analytics alternative that goes beyond just tracking website traffic, MetricsWave is the solution for you. 

Here are some reasons why:

## 1. Event-Based Tracking

Unlike Google Analytics, MetricsWave allows you to track not only your website traffic, but also specific events like user sign-ups, forms, logins, purchases, and even custom events. 

This gives you a more complete picture of how users are interacting with your website or app.

## 2. Compliance with Data Privacy Laws

Data privacy laws like GDPR, CCPA, and PECR can be a headache for businesses. But with MetricsWave, you can be sure that you're collecting data in a compliant way. 

Our platform is designed to help you meet the requirements of these regulations, so you can focus on running your business.

## 3. No Cookies Required

One of the biggest advantages of MetricsWave is that it doesn't rely on cookies to track user behavior. This means you don't have to worry about cookie consent banners or users blocking cookies. 

Instead, MetricsWave uses a unique identifier to track users across sessions and devices.

## 4. Lightweight Script

Finally, MetricsWave's tracking script is less than 1kb in size, which means it loads faster than other analytics tools. 

This can have a big impact on your website's performance, especially on mobile devices.

Overall, MetricsWave is a powerful alternative to Google Analytics that offers more flexibility, better data privacy compliance, and faster performance. 

Give it a try and see the difference for yourself!

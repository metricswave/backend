**Last week we started working on the future NotifyWave application based on all the feedback we have received.**

We are already working on the web, iOS and Android apps to be able to launch them all as soon as possible and at the same time.

For now, we are still aiming for the promised date in our roadmap of June 2023 for the first launch. We are going to get there!

If you haven't done it yet, remember that by [leaving us your email](https://notifywave.com) we will let you know of the whole process and, there are still some lifetime licenses with a unique price.

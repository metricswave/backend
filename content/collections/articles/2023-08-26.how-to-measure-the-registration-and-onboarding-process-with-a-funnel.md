The registration and onboarding process are essential in most applications. It can be the difference between a happy and active user and a user who stop using our app after a few hours.

With MetricsWave and the new funnel functionality you can measure each step, and user retention to discover if there any step where the user is blocked or not happy.

## Create your Funnel

</video>

To create a funnel simply go to the events tab and create a new funnel event. You can see the steps in the video above, it is very simple.

In this case our funnel will have three steps:

- Start SignUp
- SignUp Form
- Success

## Sending Funnel Events

Each event has his own UUID, you will need this to send the event to our API on each step.

With this UUID you just need to send two fields the `step` and the `user_id`. 

- The step should be one of the strings that you setup during the creation process. You can change them at any moment, or even add or remove.
- The UUID it's just a value for the current user, it can be a UUID, and email or an integer.

You code to sent the event on each step will look something like this:

```js
// Custom function to track events
function track(eventUuid, params) {
  fetch(`https://metricswave.com/webhooks/${eventUuid}`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "Accept": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(params),
  })
}

// Trigger the event on each step
track(
  '68fb18de-01e0-4033-af7f-67b9697daaa0',
  {step: 'Start SignUp', user_id: '45aa18ee'}
)
```

And that's it! Simply by launching the event, with a single line of code, at each step, you have measured the entire registration and onboarding process.

Do you know if your users reach the end? If they get stuck in any step? Now you will know!

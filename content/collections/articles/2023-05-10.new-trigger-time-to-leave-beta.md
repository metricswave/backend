**This feature is designed to make your daily commute easier by providing you with timely notifications that help you plan your journey.**

> üöß **Deprecated:** all the information in this article is old and it doesn't work in the current app version.

With Time To Leave, you can configure your destination, origin, travel mode, and arrival time, and receive a notification 15 minutes before it‚Äôs time to leave based on current traffic or transit status.

The Time To Leave feature is particularly useful for those who have a busy schedule and need to plan their day in advance. 

By setting your destination, origin, and travel mode, the feature will automatically calculate the estimated travel time and send you a notification 15 minutes before it‚Äôs time to leave. **This way, you can avoid getting stuck in traffic or missing your train or bus.**

### Make it your's with custom params
Also, as other triggers you will have some available params to make this notification your's and receive the message you want with the information you need.

Sometimes, Telegram notifications do not reach the specified channel. 

Despite the notification being correctly displayed in NotifyWave, the message does not appear in Telegram.

We are working on fixing it. The issue is that, sometimes, we try to send out too many notifications at once, and Telegram ends up blocking some of these messages.

From now on, **each Telegram message will be an specific queue job, so, if it fails, it will be retried**. 

This is probably a temporary solution, we keep working on it, but **if you are still having any problem with Telegram notifications, [mail us](mailto:telegram@notifywave.com)**.

**About a month ago, we introduce [new money income events](/blog/money-income-events), and now keeping track of your income is even easier with Stripe accounts!**

![MetricsWave's services available](/storage/blog/metricswave-services.png)

Instead of adding different codes to your side to track all the purchases and subscriptions payments, you can just connect your Stripe account and we will do it automatically for you.

In Settings > Services, you will find the new option to connect your Stripe account.

You only need to share a restricted api key with us. This API key only have permissions to read all the charges in your account.

It's secure and how Stripe want's you to connect external services. Here you can ind more [information about restricted API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys).

After connecting your service, we will track all the charges automatically and you will see them in your dashboard.

**Webhooks triggers are under beta testing right now, and we are planing to release the first beta of NotifyWave in the next weeks with just two triggers for now.**

Webhooks and On Time will be the first two triggers of NotifyWave.

Both are practically ready and are being tested right now by the project developers.

Our goal is to **release a first beta with these two triggers in the next few weeks for users who have a paid license**.

Then we will start working with the Google Calendar integration to add more triggers such as "Departure time", meeting notifications, invitations, etc.

The latest update includes the release of the Weather Summary trigger from beta, default titles and content for complex triggers, and a fix for Telegram notification bugs. The update aims to improve user experience and reliability.

### üÜï What's new?
- **Weather Summary trigger** is out of beta.

### üíÖ Improvements
- Add **default title and content for some complex triggers** like the weather summary. From now on you will not have to read all the documentation to get a useful notification.

### üêõ Bug fixing
- Notifications in telegram did not always arrive due to exceeding the API call limit. From now on, there is a limit of one notification per user per second to avoid this.

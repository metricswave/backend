If you want, you can make your dashboard public. You will receive a unique URL that you can share everywhere.

If you or your product follows open metrics, you can be fully transparent with your users and share your stats.

Remember that, in the dashboard, you can add not only your traffic, referrers, and paths but also events like sign-ups, logins, purchases, and more.

Soon, we are going to update our [open metrics page](https://metricswave.com/open) to use this functionality and share even more data.

Also, if you want, an example of our dashboards or to see how much traffic we have at MetricsWave, check our [traffic public dashboard](https://app.metricswave.com/fUwWlrz6Xhedh12/metricswave.com).

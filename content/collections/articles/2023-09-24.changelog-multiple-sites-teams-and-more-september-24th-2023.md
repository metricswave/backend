![Multiple Sites on MetricsWave](/storage/blog/multiple-sites--light.png)

You were asking for it. You wanted to use MetricsWave on multiple pages without constantly changing accounts and even share these sites with your team. The moment has come!

**From now on, you can create as many sites/teams as you want.**

Each site will have its own Dashboards, Events, licenses, etc. You can share each of these sites with as many users and people as you want. Really, there is no limit.

### Your team together, with the same data and Dashboards

![Your Team on MetricsWave](/storage/blog/your-team--light.png)

It's very easy, really, on the settings screen you will now find a new section from which you can manage your site.

There you can invite or remove team members and, therefore, give or remove access to different users.

After one month of operation, we have realized that what interests you most about our tool is to analyze the performance of your tools. Therefore, from now on we are **MetricsWave.com**.

But there is more.

### New Dashboards
![MetricsWave Dashboard](/images/blog/20230612082122_dashboards.png)

A metrics page must have Dashboards.

From now on, every time you enter the app you will see the Dashboard. This dashboard is configurable, you will be able to add events and metrics to your liking so that, at a glance, you can understand what is happening in your product.

This is just the beginning, soon you will be able to create projects and share access, have several different Dashboards, funnels, and more.

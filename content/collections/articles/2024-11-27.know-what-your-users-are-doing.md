![User journey on MetricsWave](/storage/blog/screenshot-2024-11-27-09.36.32.png)

**The new users section allows you to know exactly how your users use your application. Track where they click, what pages they view, the purchases they make and anything else relevant to make better decisions.**

## New User Journey View
![Track your user](/storage/blog/scr-20241127-iuti.png)

It is important to know how your users are using your tool. Do you know if they understand your product? Are they using that latest feature you have launched?

With MetricsWave you can now register your users and see their behavior.

Here you have the [documentation](/documentation/tracking/user-id) about it, but it is really simple.

If you use the tracking script, it is as easy as sending `windows.metricswave.setUser(email)` when your user logs in, and `window.metricswave.setUser(null)` when logging out.

If you want to do it manually, without the tracking script, it's also possible and it's even easier.

You just need to send a `user` parameter with all your events.

```
fetch(
    `https://metricswave.com/webhooks/${eventUuid}?source=landing&user=john@email.com`
)
```

Or, if you are using POST:

```
BODY='{"source": "landing", "user": "john@email.com"}'
curl -X POST https://metricswave.com/webhooks/[[EVENT-UUID]] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d "$BODY"
```

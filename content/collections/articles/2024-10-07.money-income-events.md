**Understand how you are monetizing your project, how much money your subscriptions generate, optimize the process, and increase your revenue with new money income events.**

The new events will help you to measure the income in your projects. 

Not only you will be able to see how much money but also when, from where and, in short, any extra parameter you want to send.

Here you have an example in which with a `source` parameter we see where the income comes from, in this case, a subscription, but you could also register the user, the web, or anything else that helps to understand your project and how it earns money.

We are looking forward to see how you use these new events to track your sites. [**Here you have all the documentation about it.**](/documentation/tracking/money-income)

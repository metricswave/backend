The latest update adds a new global ﻿emoji parameter for webhooks, improves trigger form validation, and fixes a bug where channels were not being saved when creating a new trigger.

### 🆕 What's new?
- New global `emoji` param on all webhooks. Now you can change your emoji dynamically. [Here's how.](/documentation/triggers/webhooks#dynamic-emoji)

### 💅 Improvements
- Trigger create and edit form is now validated, and it shows errors when there are some required fields missing or invalid.

### 🐛 Bug fixing
- When creating a new trigger there was an error that caused the channels not to be saved. Now it's fine.

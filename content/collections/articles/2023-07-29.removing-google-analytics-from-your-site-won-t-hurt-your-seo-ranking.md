**On the contrary, it is possible that switching from Google Analytics to MetricsWave can improve your ranking by improving load time.**

There are some people who still think that deleting GA tracking code from your site can hurt your search engine rankings, which is simply not true.

According to [John Mueller](https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1012320567381422081), a Google Search Developer, there's no penalty for not using GA.

Google does not penalize websites for not using Google Analytics, and this applies to all search engines. 

The utilization of Google's script or an alternative to Google Analytics does not impact a site's ranking.

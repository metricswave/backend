Feedback is very important for any business, whether it is an app or a website, it is important to know which parts of our app the user likes and which are not.

This way you can improve your project and make it a better option for your users.

The normal thing is to make a small form and send you an email each time the user fills it out. This works, but you have to be setting up SMTP services, creating endpoints, etc.

With MetricsWave, you just create an event and execute the following request to the client, it's that easy.

```javascript
fetch(`https://metricswave.com/webhooks/${eventUuid}`, {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message, 
      path: window.location.pathname
    }),
})
```

This is how our new feedback form works, you can see it in the bottom right corner of the app!

And this is the event, a simple one with two params: `path` and `message`.

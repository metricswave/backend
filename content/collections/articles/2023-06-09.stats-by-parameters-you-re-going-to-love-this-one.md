The possibilities are endless.

For example, I have created a trigger in which **I register all the visits to my website** with a parameter, `path`.

I'm calling this trigger every time someone loads my page and I'm sending the param path using javascript. This it's how
it looks:

```javascript
fetch(`https://metricswave.com/webhook/${uuid}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        path: location.pathname,
    }),
})
```

Now, inside the Trigger view, I have a personal analytics service. A privacy-friendly service where I can track visits
without violating the user's privacy.

### Track your deploys and get useful data

Here is another idea.

Create a webhook trigger with four params in this case (author, message, version and service).

Every time you make a deploy, execute the next curl request.

```curl
BODY='{"version":"'$(git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 1)'", "message":"'$(git log --pretty=format:'%s' -n 1)'","author":"'$(git log --pretty=format:'%an' -n 1)'", "service":"Backend"}'

curl -X POST https://metricswave.com/webhooks/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d "$BODY"
```

Just with this, you will be able to see how many deploys your are doing by day or month, how, and which service is
deployed more often.

You can also [connect your Telegram channel](/documentation/services/telegram) and/or a Slack channel (soon), and you
will receive a notification in realtime after each deploy.

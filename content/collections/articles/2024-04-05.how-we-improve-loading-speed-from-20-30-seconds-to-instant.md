  This year, MetricsWave is growing a lot. The number of events has 3x in the last months, and we still run in an small server. Even that the service still have 99% uptime, our dashboards performance decreased and the experience was not good enough, until today.

![+3M events per months - MetricsWave](/images/blog/20240405090747_events_per_month_metricswave.png)

This year, MetricsWave is growing a lot. **The number of events has 3x in the last months**, and we still run in a small server. Even that the service still has 99.99% uptime, our dashboards performance decreased and the experience was not good enough, until today.

## A bit of context
The main problem was related to the visit metrics and the data associated with them (Country, Language, Reference, Destination Page, etc).

As of today **we have +21 million different records**. It's not a huge number, it's a manageable number, but this project is still **running on a small, simple server** and that was a challenge.

**Each query to this data took, on average, between 10-20 seconds**. This was clearly reflected in the dashboards, affecting loading time.

Furthermore, this data had become unmanageable. Making a transformation on the data was totally unfeasible.

## What have we done?
Many changes, really.

We have realized that **most users access recent data** and rarely the history of the previous year, for example.

Also, in most cases, in the dashboard, each widget shows a single piece of data, but we had the loading optimized to obtain all the data at the same time.

And finally, many times **we access exactly the same data, but simply changing the display** of it.

With all this information we have made several changes to the structure in which we store the data and how we now load it **dashboards load instantly**.

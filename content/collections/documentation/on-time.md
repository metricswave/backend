This type of triggers are very simple.

You have two possible values to set:

- **Time:** in 24 hours format, when you want to receive the notification.
- **Day of the week:** Which day or days you want to receive the notification.

Some use cases for which this notification may be useful are:

- Reminders to take your medication.
- Reminders to go to bed early.
- Reminders to water the plants.
- Reminders for specific tasks that occur with a certain frequency.

Among others.

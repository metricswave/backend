**Telegram groups allow you to receive notifications there in a simple and unobtrusive way.**


## How to connect your channel or group

If you want to connect a group or channel, simply follow the steps below:

1. Create the channel or group and invite [@NotifyWaveBot](https://t.me/NotifyWaveBot) as an administrator, it's mandatory.

2. Invite [@IDBot](https://t.me/myidbot) to the channel. This bot will help you to see the ID of your channel or group, then you can remove it from the group if you want.

3. Now you just need to see the group ID. To do this, type in the channel `/getgroupid@myidbot`. The bot will reply a second later with your group ID (it is a negative number).

4. Copy and paste this ID into the creation form of this service along with a name, to remember the channel.

5. Done, you now have the channel configured and connected to NotifyWave.

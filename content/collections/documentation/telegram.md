**Telegram groups allow you to receive notifications there in a simple and unobtrusive way.**

## How to connect your channel or group

If you want to connect a group or channel, simply follow the steps below:

1. Create the channel or group and invite [@MetricsWaveBot](https://t.me/MetricsWaveBot).

2. Now you just need to see the group ID. To do this, type `/connect@MetricsWaveBot`. The bot will reply a second later
   with your group ID (it is a negative number).

3. Copy and paste this ID into the creation form of this service along with a name, to remember the channel.

5. Done, you now have the channel configured and connected to MetricsWave.

## How to create a Group

I'm going to use the desktop version of Telegram but the process it's almost the same on all platforms.

![Create Telegram Group](/images/documentation/telegram_group_1.png)

1. The first thing it's to, in the left drawer, create a new group.
2. Type any name for the group.

![Add MetricsWaveBot](/images/documentation/telegram_group_2.png)

3. Now you will see a list of users to add new members to the group. Just search for @MetricsWaveBot and add it.
4. Press `Create` button and that's, all. Your group is ready.

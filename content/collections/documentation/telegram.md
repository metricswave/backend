**Telegram groups allow you to receive notifications there in a simple and unobtrusive way.**

## How to connect your channel or group

If you want to connect a group or channel, simply follow the steps below:

1. Create the channel or group and invite [@NotifyWaveBot](https://t.me/NotifyWaveBot).

2. Now you just need to see the group ID. To do this, type `/connect@NotifyWaveBot`. The bot will reply a second later
   with your group ID (it is a negative number).

3. Copy and paste this ID into the creation form of this service along with a name, to remember the channel.

5. Done, you now have the channel configured and connected to MetricsWave.

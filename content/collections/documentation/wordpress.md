## How to measure your traffic

Inside your **WordPress Dashboard**, go to Appearance â†’ Editor. Click the `header.php` file to edit its code and add the next code just before the end `</head>` tag.

Something like this:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!-- Other tags in your file -->


  <!-- Add MetricsWave visit script -->
  <script defer
          event-uuid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
          src="https://metricswave.com/js/visits.js"></script>
</head>

<body <?php body_class(); ?>>

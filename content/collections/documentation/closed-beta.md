For now, **NotifyWave is still in closed beta**. Only paying users can create an account right now and access the application.

NotifyWave is functional, but it still lacks many features that we are working on and many others that we are polishing and improving.

Therefore, for now, it is closed to the general public.

**If you want to open your account and start using it, below you can find lifetime licenses.**

We don't know for sure yet what the final price will be, but I assure you that it will be higher than what we are offering right now and, probably, it will be a yearly subscription and not a single payment.

Also, **if you join now, you will help us to create the application you want** and make it work the way you would like it to work. 

Help us define the future of NotifyWave now.

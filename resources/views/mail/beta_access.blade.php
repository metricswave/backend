Hi ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Victor, in case you didn't know me yet, and I'm the creator of {{ config('app.name') }}.

As you probably already know, we are opening access to our beta little by little and, as one of the first users to trust us, YOU CAN ALREADY ACCESS.

It is a very early version and I want you to know that I am here to help you with any questions or suggestions. I want to hear your opinion about the app.

Here is the link to access the web application, but **don't forget to reply to this email**.

Tell me what would you like to improve? What do you miss? What do you want to add? Is there anything you don't understand or doesn't work? Whatever it is, reply to this email.

Access {{ config('app.name') }}
</x-mail::button>

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ PD: Si quieres puedes responder en espaÃ±ol, que el idioma no sea un problema.

Thanks,<br>
